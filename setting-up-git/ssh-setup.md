# SSH-Setup

We're don't do HTTPS here. 

* Generate ssh-key if you're on a new install by

```text
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" 
```

Save it. in the default location specified.

* Start ssh-agent `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
* Check if there's any ssh configs files already generated by

  ```text
  open ~/.ssh/config
  ```

  If not, then do it by 

* ```text
  touch ~/.ssh/config
  nano ~/.ssh/config
  ```

  When you're in `nano`, add the following to the file

* ```text
  Host *
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    UseKeychain yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  ```

* Then add the ssh-key to the agent `ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
* Copy the pub file to clipboard using `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` and then paste it in Github Settings -&gt; [SSH/GPG Keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)
* Test SSH connection by `ssh -T git@github.com`and if the fingerprinting request matches `github.com` and RSA key is `SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8` then accept the connection.
* You should see this message and that means it's working correctly
* ```text
  > Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not
  > provide shell access.
  ```

* After that configure your username and email in git
* ```text
  git config --global user.name "i3p9"
  git config --global user.email your_email@example.com
  ```

  All done!
