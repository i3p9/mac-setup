# SSH-Setup

We're don't do HTTPS here. 

* Generate ssh-key if you're on a new install by

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" 
```

Save it. in the default location specified.

* Start ssh-agent `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
* Check if there's any ssh configs files already generated by

  ```bash
  open ~/.ssh/config
  ```

  If not, then do it by 

* ```bash
  touch ~/.ssh/config
  nano ~/.ssh/config
  ```

  When you're in `nano`, add the following to the file

* ```bash
  Host *
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    UseKeychain yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  ```

* Then add the ssh-key to the agent `ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
* Copy the pub file to clipboard using `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` and then paste it in Github Settings -&gt; [SSH/GPG Keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)
* Test SSH connection by `ssh -T git@github.com`and if the fingerprinting request matches `github.com` and RSA key is `SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8` then accept the connection.
* You should see this message and that means it's working correctly
* ```bash
  > Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not
  > provide shell access.
  ```

* After that configure your username and email in git
* ```bash
  git config --global user.name "i3p9"
  git config --global user.email your_email@example.com
  ```

  All done!

### Special note regarding making sure that you're using ssh to make changes to your repository

Note that after you've setup SSH, if you clone the project via HTTP, then the changes you make will also be done via HTTP. So to check weather or not you're using HTTPS, do this when you're inside the repository.
```bash
git remote
>origin

git remote get-url origin
>https://github.com/username/repo
```
if the `git remote get-url origin` reports a `https` link, it means you are pushing all the changes via `https`. To change that to `ssh`, just do this
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo
```
If it has worked perfectly, then when running `git remote get-url origin` you'll get this
```bash
git remote get-url origin
>git@github.com:user/repo
```
