# Setting up Applications

This is gonna take some time. Let's start with the basic brew apps that needs configuration.

#### brew apps

Let's install the rest of the applications.

```bash
brew install git wget youtube-dl aria2 tree tvnamer mas gnupg thefuck tldr
```

#### brew cask apps

Let's hop on over to the GUI apps, using `--cask`

**Basic Apps (Essentials)**
```bash
brew install --cask google-chrome spotify iina iterm2 typora maccy discord authy coteditor
```

**Productivity + Utilities**
```bash
brew install --cask notion slack appcleaner imageoptim avibrazil-rdm numi mac2imgur controlplane mos android-file-transfer android-platform-tools cyberduck unified-remote lulu handbrake dozer monitorcontrol cloudflare-warp jdownloader transmission transmission-remote-gui keka lyricsx altserver
```

**Programming Basics**
```bash
brew install --cask temurin docker visual-studio-code xampp
```

```
NOTE: This is a personalized for my needs, please remove/add applications you prefer, best way would be to fork, then edit so you have your own version
```

That's gonna take some time. In the meantime you should start setting up Git and integrate it with Github.
