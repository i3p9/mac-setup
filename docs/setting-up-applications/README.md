# Setting up Applications

This is gonna take some time. Let's start with the basic brew apps that needs configuration.

#### install homebrew

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

#### brew apps

Let's install the rest of the applications.

```bash
brew install wget youtube-dl aria2 tree tvnamer mas pinentry-mac gnupg thefuck tldr switchaudio-osx
```

#### brew cask apps

Let's hop on over the GUI apps, using `--cask`

```bash
brew install --cask adoptopenjdk lulu dozer alt-tab handbrake monitorcontrol altserver iina notion appcleaner imageoptim slack authy iterm2 spotify avibrazil-rdm jdownloader transmission cloudflare-warp keka transmission-remote-gui discord lyricsx typora docker numi mac2imgur visual-studio-code google-chrome maccy xampp cyberduck unified-remote coteditor
```

That's gonna take some time. In the meantime you should start setting up Git and integrate it with Github.
