# VS Code Setup

VS Code configuration is mostly handled by Settings Sync (id: `shan.code-settings-sync`). So open up VSCode, download the extension Settings Sync. 

Click on the cogwheel bottom left, and download settings from Github Gist.

### Worst Case Scenario

If the sync fails, here's a general idea of how it's setup. 
- Files: AutoSave -> `AfterDelay`
- Font Size: `16`
- Font Family: `Iosevka`
- Color Theme: `Dark+`

Extensions:
- Composer
- Jupyter
- Laravel Blade Snippets
- Markdown All in One
- Markdown Preview Enchanced
- No Code
- Path Intellisense
- PHP Debug
- PHP Extension Pack
- PHP Intelephense
- PropertyList
- Python
- Settings Sync
- vscode-icons
