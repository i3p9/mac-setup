# Configuring tvnamer

The package `tvnamer` should already be downloaded via brew in the previous stage.

Now download and save the tvnamer config file in the right directory
```
cd ~/.config/
mkdir tvrenamer
cd tvrenamer
wget https://github.com/i3p9/mac-setup/raw/main/files/tvnamer.json
```

Should be good to go.
