# Raycast Scripts for QOL Improvements

## Handling Screenshots

Visit my [raycast repository](https://github.com/i3p9/raycast-scripts), my own scripts will be uploaded there and the [official Repository](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands) for a huge amount of useful scripts. I will eventually write detailed installation method for my scripts but for now the instructions in the repository will help.

One of my most favorite script I made is `clipboard-upload-to-imgur.sh`, from it's description:

```bash
It does two things:

You copy a image in Finder, run it and it uploads the image, copies link to clipboard

You have a image in clipboard (Eg. ⇧+⌃+⌘ +4, or copy an image from the web),
run the script and it gets uploaded to Imgur, link gets copied to Clipboard.
```

It's geniunely useful and saves a *lot* of time.
